# Introduction to SQL

The **Introduction to SQL** course goes over the basics of SQL and DDL, and covers querying a database, sorting results, and using joins and unions. It covers how to aggregate and filter data. We also look at how to create a table, and drop it.

First, review the [slides for the **Introduction to SQL course**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-FhnRYrehe3VSlITi6geGqh-DrtSP6nPN4tiPgpbGqQ/present). 

After you are comfortable with the material, install Python and Visual Studio Code on your computer, download the code, and open the project folder in Visual Studio Code. Open each Jupyter Notebook, and follow the notes.
